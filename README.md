TailwindCSS + Framer + Shadow CLJS mini example
===============================================

Sometimes painful for me.. work with Headless UI in Clojurescript. I think use Framer Motion much much easier and not limited (quite similar like Lottie wrapper for React Native). That isnâ€™t the best mini example project, but I hope helpful who would like to try out Framer Motion quickly.

Simply clone this repo and use as described in Jacek Shae's Tailwind JIT example repo:

 [https://github.com/jacekschae/shadow-cljs-tailwindcss](https://github.com/jacekschae/shadow-cljs-tailwindcss.git)

That is based on this. Open two terminal and execute two commands: tailwind and shadow-cljs dev

npm run postcss:watch

npm run dev

Add Framer Motion to your project:

 yarn add framer-motion
